               <h2 id="location">Boundry Waters, MN</h2>
               <p id="testp" class="funParagraph">This is one of my favorite places on earth. From island hopping by kayak to stargazing the least light polluted skies I've seen, boundry waters is a must see. With the northern lights visable part of the year this is the best camp site I can recommend.  </p>
               <h3>$</h3>
               <p><b>Price:</b> Very inexpensive. If you have camping gear then you only have to plan for food and the cost of travel. </p>

               <h2 id="location">Virgin Islands</h2>
               <p> The tropical paradise of your dreams. Most of the islands are nature preserves so it's less populated then other tropical getaways. Spend the day snorkeling the reefs or basking in the sun. Finish it up with a rum punch at sunset.    </p>
               <h3>$$$$</h3>
               <p><b>Price:</b> Very Expensive. Planning this trip far in advance will help you with expenses.  </p>

               <h2 id="location">Iceland</h2>
               <p>Landscapes that look other worldly. Iceland is a breathtaking country from it's green mountains to it's bright blue hot springs. Sightseeing in the icelandic country side was something I'll never forget.   </p>
               <h3>$$$</h3>
               <p><b>Price:</b> Very expensive. Back in 2016ish the flights were much cheaper. With todays flights itll be a lot more expensive. That and most things are imported into Iceland.   </p>

               <h2 id="location">Chicago, IL</h2>
               <p>There are endless things to see and do in this windy city. With Chicago only being a mere 4 hour drive or quick train ride from Saint Louis I highly recommend it for a weekend getaway.  </p>
               <h3>$$</h3>

               <h2 id="location">Lake of the Ozarks, MO</h2>
               <p>The perfect spot for a cheap vacation. Rent a boat or just take a dip off the dock the lake has a lot of bang for it's buck. </p>

               <h2 id="location">Santa Cruz, CA</h2>
               <p>Picturesque beach town in northern California. The perfect place for a surf trip or to go tide pooling. Hit up the boardwalk for endless acitivities then end the day watching the sunset on the rocky coast.    </p>
