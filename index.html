               <h2>Boundry Waters, MN</h2>
               <p>A place Ive been twice and plan to go more throughout my life. You can see the Northern lights during fall/winter seasons at night, accompanied by some of the best stargazing Ive seen. Your days are spent either prepping your food and water for the day or out looking for a new camping spot with all new sites and critters to enjoy. All in all the boundry waters is an absolute must for camping/kayaking enthusits. </p>
               <h3>$</h3>
               <p>Price: Very inexpensive. Could easily be done with a few friends. Bringing your own gear could save you a lot, leaving food as one of the only expensises. </p>
